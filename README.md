# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Depression-Data-from-NIMH
Using data visualization techniques, I conducted an exploratory data analysis project on a study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Their study compared the effectiveness of two active drugs: lithium and imipramine against major depressive disorder. The trial was completed using a placebo control group, a lithium treatment group, and an imipramine treatment control all of equal sizes (Fig 1). Data visualization of the raw data set from the study of 109 participants demonstrate correlation between: gender and treatment effectiveness, duration of depressive period prior to study and likelihood of recurrence of depressive symptoms, and effectiveness of each groupâ€™s treatment plan against recurrence.
